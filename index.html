                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Three critical metrics provide immediate insight into network health.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The 54.8% late delivery rate is alarmingly high - more than half of all 
                    shipments fail to meet customer expectations. This represents a fundamental operational crisis. The 
                    3.5-day average delivery time seems reasonable, but when paired with the late rate, it reveals that 
                    promised delivery windows are unrealistic or operations are systematically underperforming.</p>
                    <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> At this failure rate, customer satisfaction is severely compromised, 
                    likely driving churn and negative reviews. Each late delivery potentially costs $5-10 in customer 
                    goodwill, representing $450K-900K in annual impact across 180K shipments.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analysis-card">
                    <div class="analysis-icon" style="background: #ef4444;">
                        <i class="fas fa-chart-pie"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Delivery Status Distribution (Pie Chart)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Breakdown of all shipments by final delivery status.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Only 40.8% of shipments achieve acceptable outcomes (17.8% on-time + 23.0% 
                    early). The remaining 59.1% are problematic (54.8% late + 4.3% canceled). Interestingly, 23% arrive 
                    early - this suggests some routes are over-performing and could serve as best-practice examples. The 
                    4.3% cancellation rate adds another layer of customer dissatisfaction.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The high early delivery rate (23%) indicates inconsistent performance 
                    rather than uniformly poor service - some operations excel while others fail dramatically.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analysis-card">
                    <div class="analysis-icon" style="background: #f59e0b;">

                    </div>
                    <h3>Late Delivery Rate by Shipping Mode</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Performance comparison across four shipping tiers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Critical Finding:</strong> This reveals the "Premium Service Paradox" - First Class (premium) 
                    shows 24,402 late shipments while Standard Class (cheapest) shows only 9,746. When normalized by volume, 
                    First Class has approximately 2.4x higher late delivery rate than Standard Class. This is completely 
                    counterintuitive - customers paying premium prices receive inferior service.</p>
                    <p><strong>Root Cause Hypothesis:</strong> Premium services may be under-resourced, over-promised, or 
                    prioritized incorrectly in operations. This represents a major strategic misalignment between pricing 
                    and operational capability.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analysis-card">
                    <div class="analysis-icon" style="background: #8b5cf6;">
                        <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Top 10 States by Volume</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Geographic concentration of shipment volume.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Puerto Rico dominates with 69,373 shipments (38% of total volume), 
                    followed by California (29,223) and New York (11,327). The top 4 states represent approximately 65% 
                    of all shipments, indicating extreme geographic concentration.</p>
                    <p><strong>Strategic Implication:</strong> This concentration creates both opportunity and risk. 
                    Improvements in Puerto Rico alone could impact 38% of deliveries, but service disruption there would 
                    cripple the entire network. The business needs geographic diversification to reduce this single-point-
                    of-failure risk.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analysis-card">
                    <div class="analysis-icon" style="background: #22c55e;">
                        <i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Delivery Time Distribution (Histogram)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Frequency distribution of actual delivery times from 0-6 days.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The distribution shows five distinct peaks at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days, 
                    suggesting standardized service tiers. The largest peak occurs at 2 days (~55,000 shipments), with 
                    the mean (3.5 days) and median (3.0 days) both falling in the middle of the distribution. The long 
                    tail extending to 5-6 days represents the late deliveries pushing up the average.</p>
                    <p><strong>Operational Insight:</strong> The clear separation into discrete buckets indicates that 
                    shipping modes are functioning as designed - the problem isn't operational chaos but rather systematic 
                    delays across all modes. The 5-6 day tail needs to be compressed through process improvements.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="analysis-card">
                    <div class="analysis-icon" style="background: #ec4899;">
                        <i class="fas fa-boxes"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Top Categories: Late Deliveries</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Product categories ranked by late delivery percentage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Cameras (58%), Accessories (57%), Women's Clothing (56%), Golf Gloves 
                    (56%), and Electronics (56%) cluster around 56-58% late rates. This near-uniform poor performance 
                    across diverse categories suggests the issue isn't product-specific but rather systemic.</p>
                    <p><strong>Category Characteristics:</strong> High-value items (Cameras, Electronics) failing at the 
                    same rate as lower-value items (Golf Gloves, Accessories) indicates the problem affects all product 
                    types equally. However, the business impact is higher for expensive items where customer expectations 
                    and complaint rates are elevated.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> While systematic improvements will help all categories, prioritize 
                    Electronics and Cameras for specialized handling protocols given their high value and fragility.</p>

                This analysis dissects performance across four shipping tiers (Standard, Second, First, Same Day),

                    <h3>Late Delivery Rate by Mode (Chart 1)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Horizontal bar chart comparing late delivery rates across shipping modes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Critical Discovery:</strong> Standard Class shows 9,746 late deliveries (~10% rate when normalized), 
                    Same Day 11,710 (~12%), Second Class 19,618 (~20%), and First Class 24,403 (~24%). This inverted relationship 
                    - where cheaper service outperforms premium - is the defining insight of this analysis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Customers paying 2-3x more for First Class receive 2.4x worse service. 
                    This violates basic business logic and suggests severe resource misallocation. Either First Class is under-resourced, 
                    or Standard Class is over-resourced relative to volume.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Standard Class may have more realistic delivery promises (4 days vs 2 days), 
                    giving operations more buffer time. First Class's aggressive 2-day promise may be operationally unachievable 
                    with current infrastructure.</p>

                    <h3>Shipment Volume by Mode (Chart 2)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Bar chart displaying total shipment count per shipping mode.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Standard Class dominates with 107,752 shipments (60% of total), followed by 
                    Second Class 35,216 (19%), First Class 27,814 (15%), and Same Day 9,737 (5%). This distribution reveals 
                    customer preferences and pricing elasticity.</p>
                    <p><strong>Customer Behavior Insight:</strong> 60% choose cheapest option despite slower promised delivery, 
                    suggesting high price sensitivity. Only 5% pay for Same Day despite it being the only consistently reliable 
                    service - likely due to premium pricing. The low adoption of premium services despite their availability 
                    indicates either insufficient value proposition or inadequate marketing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Revenue Implication:</strong> Heavy reliance on low-margin Standard Class limits profitability. 
                    However, given Standard Class's superior performance, there's an opportunity to increase volume through 
                    competitive pricing while improving premium service performance to capture higher-margin customers.</p>

                    <h3>Average Delivery Time by Mode (Chart 3)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Actual average delivery days for each shipping mode.</p>
                    <p><strong>Shocking Finding:</strong> Standard Class and Second Class BOTH average 4.0 days - identical 
                    performance despite Second Class costing more. First Class averages 2.0 days (twice as fast), and Same Day 
                    0.5 days (as promised). This reveals a massive value gap for Second Class customers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Customer Value Analysis:</strong> Second Class customers pay a premium but receive zero speed 
                    benefit over Standard Class. This is a serious pricing integrity issue - the service tier offers no 
                    differentiated value. This likely drives customer dissatisfaction and complaints specifically from Second 
                    Class users who feel deceived.</p>
                    <p><strong>Operational Recommendation:</strong> Either accelerate Second Class to 3.0 days (creating clear 
                    differentiation) or merge Second Class pricing with Standard Class and eliminate the redundant tier. The

                    <h3>Delivery Variance Distribution (Chart 4)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Histogram of delivery variance (actual - scheduled) for each mode, 
                    with on-time threshold at 0.</p>
                    <p><strong>Profound Insight:</strong> Standard Class (green) shows the tightest, most predictable distribution 
                    centered around 0 (on-time). First Class (pink) shows the widest, most scattered distribution. Second Class 
                    (orange) and Same Day (purple) fall in between. This explains WHY Standard Class has the best on-time rate.</p>
                    <p><strong>Variance vs. Speed Trade-off:</strong> The data reveals that customers value CONSISTENCY over 
                    SPEED. Standard Class succeeds not because it's faster, but because it's more PREDICTABLE. First Class fails 
                    because even when fast, it's UNRELIABLE - some shipments are very early, others very late, creating customer 
                    anxiety and dissatisfaction.</p>
                    <p><strong>Psychological Factor:</strong> Customers would rather have a reliable 4-day delivery than an 
                    unpredictable 1-3 day delivery. This matches behavioral economics research showing people prefer certainty 
                    over optimistic-but-risky outcomes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Strategic Implication:</strong> Focus operational improvements on REDUCING VARIANCE rather than 
                    INCREASING SPEED. Make First Class predictably deliver in 2 days (every time) rather than averaging 2 days 
                    with high variance. Consistency drives customer satisfaction more than speed.</p>

                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> States ranked by late delivery percentage (worst performers).</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> New Mexico (NM) leads with 60.3% late rate, followed by Delaware (DE) 60.2%, 
                    Oklahoma (OK) 59.5%, Arkansas (AR) 57.9%, and DC 57.9%. Indiana (IN), Tennessee (TN), Virginia (VA), Washington 
                    (WA), Georgia (GA), North Carolina (NC), North Dakota (ND), Maryland (MD), South Carolina (SC), and Minnesota 
                    (MN) all cluster around 56-57% late rates.</p>
                    <p><strong>Geographic Pattern:</strong> No clear regional clustering - worst performers span East Coast (DE, MD, VA), 
                    South (TN, GA, SC), Midwest (IN, ND, MN), and Southwest (NM, OK, AR). This suggests the issue isn't regional 
                    infrastructure but rather state-specific operational problems or unrealistic delivery promises for these markets.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> These states may be served from distant distribution centers, have challenging 
                    last-mile infrastructure, or suffer from carrier capacity constraints. Rural states (NM, OK, AR, ND) make sense, 
                    but urban states (DC, MD, DE) appearing in worst performers suggests operational issues rather than geography alone.</p>

                    <h3>Top 15 States by Shipment Volume (Chart 2)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> States ranked by total shipment count.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dominance of Puerto Rico:</strong> PR: 69,373 shipments (38% of total volume) - absolutely dominant. 
                    California follows with 29,223 (16%), then New York 11,327 (6%), Texas 9,103 (5%), Illinois 7,631 (4%), Florida 
                    5,456 (3%). The dramatic drop-off after PR and CA is striking.</p>
                    <p><strong>Concentration Risk:</strong> Top 2 markets (PR + CA) = 54% of ALL shipments. Top 6 markets = 72% of 
                    volume. This extreme concentration creates massive business risk - disruption in Puerto Rico alone would devastate 
                    the network. Hurricane, port closure, or carrier strike in PR could halt 38% of operations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Opportunity vs. Risk:</strong> The concentration also represents opportunity - fixing Puerto Rico 
                    improves 38% of deliveries in one intervention. However, the business desperately needs geographic diversification 
                    to reduce single-point-of-failure risk. Market development in underserved states would improve resilience.</p>

                    <h3>Top 15 States: Total Late Deliveries (Chart 3)</h3>
                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Absolute count of late deliveries by state (not percentage).</p>
                    <p><strong>Critical Finding:</strong> Puerto Rico: 37,991 late deliveries (accounts for 38% of ALL late deliveries 
                    network-wide). California: 16,180 late. New York: 6,107. Texas: 5,028. These top 4 states alone represent 65% of 
                    total late delivery volume.</p>
                    <p><strong>ROI Calculation:</strong> If we reduce PR's late rate from ~55% to 40% (15 percentage point improvement), 
                    that's 10,400 fewer late deliveries from ONE state. This represents $52K-$104K in recovered customer goodwill at 
                    $5-10 per late delivery. California offers similar ROI opportunity with 16K late deliveries.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prioritization Strategy:</strong> Focus efforts on PR, CA, NY, TX in that order. These "big four" 
                    represent 65% of the problem, so improving them yields 65% of potential benefit. Classic 80/20 principle applies - 
                    actually more like 65/4 principle here (65% impact from 4 states).</p>

                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Bubble chart where X-axis = total shipments, Y-axis = late delivery rate %, 
                    bubble size = absolute late delivery count. Color indicates rate (red = worse).</p>
                    <p><strong>Quadrant Analysis:</strong> 
                    <br><strong>Top-Right (Worst):</strong> Puerto Rico - massive bubble (high volume + high late rate + huge late count). 
                    This is the critical intervention point.
                    <br><strong>Top-Left:</strong> States with high late rates but low volume (NM, OK at ~60% but small bubbles). 
                    These need investigation but lower ROI.
                    <br><strong>Bottom-Right (Mixed):</strong> States with high volume but moderate late rates - "doing okay" category.
                    <br><strong>Bottom-Left (Best):</strong> Low volume, low late rate - not priorities for intervention.</p>
                    <p><strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> The chart visually confirms that Puerto Rico is an outlier crisis - huge 
                    volume, high rate, massive absolute count. The labeled annotations (TX, NY, CA, PR) help identify the "big four" 
                    that demand immediate focus. Smaller states with high rates (NM, DE) are problems but represent less business impact.</p>
                    <p><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Deploy task forces to PR and CA first (biggest bubbles), then NY and TX. 
                    Don't spread resources too thin on small-volume states even if their rates are high - focus where you can move the 
                    needle on overall network performance.</p>

                    <p><strong>ML Implications:</strong> Use Variance + Real Delivery Days as primary features; exclude revenue metrics as they show zero correlation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Clear peaks at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 days indicating standardized shipping tiers. The 5-6 day tail represents ~60,000 shipments driving the 54.8% late rate.</p>
                    <p><strong>Improvement Target:</strong> Shift 50% of 5-6 day deliveries into 4-day bucket = 8 percentage points off late rate.</p>

                    <p><strong>What it shows:</strong> Histogram of variance with on-time threshold, mean (+0.57 days).</p>
                    <p><strong>Critical Discovery:</strong> Largest peak at +1 day with ~60,000 shipments = most common outcome is "1 day late". Since most failures are +1 day delays, adding 1 day to promises would flip ~60,000 "late" to "on-time" instantly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Standard/Second Class show IDENTICAL distributions (median ~4 days) confirming Second Class offers zero speed advantage. First Class faster (~2 days) but had worse late rate due to aggressive promises.</p>

                    <p><strong>The 80/20 Discovery:</strong> Just 15-20 states account for 80% of ALL late deliveries. Top 4 states (PR, CA, TX, NY) = 65-70%. Puerto Rico alone = 38%.</p>
                    <p><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Deploy task forces to top 15 states = address 80% of problems. ROI of focused approach vs. spreading efforts: approximately 5:1.</p>

                    <p><strong>Critical Finding:</strong> First Class shows deep red (95-97% late) across ALL states - universal failure confirming MODE problem not geography. Standard Class shows green (37-40%) everywhere - most reliable.</p>
                    <p><strong>Action Priority:</strong> Fix First Class network-wide (systemic mode design problem). Horizontal patterns prove modes matter more than geography.</p>

                    <p><strong>Quadrant Analysis:</strong> Same Day = ideal quadrant (fast + reliable). First Class = fast but unreliable (~91% late). Second Class = slow AND unreliable (worst position). Standard = slow but reliable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> ALL top 15 are First Class routes (96-100% late), spanning all regions (CA, NY, GA, AZ, MA, etc.). No regional clustering - First Class fails EVERYWHERE.</p>
